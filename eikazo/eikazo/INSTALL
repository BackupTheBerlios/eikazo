To install this package, run::

	python setup.py build

and (with root privileges)::

	python setup.py install

Before you do this, make sure that the following programs / libraries
are installed on your system:

  - `Python <http://www.python.org>`_
  - Python's distutils and the Python development package
  - a C compiler (gcc most probably)
  - `SANE <http://sane-project.org/>`_ 
  - `PyGTK <http://www.pygtk.org>`_ (in some Linux distributions called python-gtk)
  - `Python Imaging Library <http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/index.htm>`_ (PIL)
    Version 1.1.6 of PIL is _strongly_ recommended, because

     - older versions lock other Python threads while scan data is acquired, 
       making the GUI "unresponsive" during data acquisition. 
     - older version have a bug that makes it impossible to read the 
       backside image from duplex scanners.
    
    In some Linux distributions, PIL's Sane libraries are not
    part of the default PIL package.
    In this case you must install PIL's Sane module manually from
    the source files. Either download the sources from the 
    pythonware website, or install the sources that hopefully came 
    with your operating system.
    
  - To try the SQLSample output plugin, you must install or have access to 
    a MySQL or PostgreSQL database; and a Python database adapter must 
    be installed. At present, these adapters are supprted:
    
    - `MySQLdb <http://sourceforge.net/projects/mysql-python>`_  by Andy
      Dustman, 
    - `PyGreSQL <http://pygresql.org/>`_ by Pascal Andre and D'Arcy J.M. 
      Cain
    - `Psycopg <http://www.initd.org/>`_ by Michele Comitini and Federico
