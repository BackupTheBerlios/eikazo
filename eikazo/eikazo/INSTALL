To install this package, run::

	python setup.py build

and (with root privileges)::

	python setup.py install

Before you do this, make sure that the following programs / libraries
are installed on your system:

  - `Python <http://www.python.org>`_
  - Python's distutils and the Python development package
  - a C compiler (gcc most probably)
  - `SANE <http://sane-project.org/>`_ 
  - `PyGTK <http://www.pygtk.org>`_ (in some Linux distributions called python-gtk)
  - `Python Imaging Library <http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/index.htm>`_ (PIL)
    
    In some Linux distributions, PIL's Sane libraries are not
    part of the default PIL package.
    In this case you must install PIL's Sane module manually from
    the source files. Either download the sources from the 
    pythonware website, or install the sources that hopefully came 
    with your operating system.
    
    To install the Sane module, run ``python setup.py build`` and
    ``python setup.py install`` **directly** in the Sane subdirectory. 
	

For PIL, the usage of a patched version of its source files Sane/_sane.c 
and Sane/sane.py is strongly recommended. The patched files are located 
in the directory PIL in this package. The patch allows the Python interpreter 
to run other threads, while one thread reads data from a scanner. Without 
this patch, the thread controlling the program's GUI and and other threads
which process the data of already scanned images are blocked until the 
scan is finished. The patch will probably be included in version 1.1.6 of 
PIL (http://effbot.python-hosting.com/ticket/50).

Additionally, the files in the directory PIL have patches which improve 
support for duplex ADF scanners and fix for a possible buffer overflow. 
(The former patch is already included in the alpha versions of PIL 1.1.6)
