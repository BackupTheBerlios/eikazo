The files in the directory are not part of Eikazo. They are
patched versions of PIL's Sane module. The patches will
probably be included in PIL 1.1.6.

copy the file in this directory into the subdirectory Sane
of the PIL source tree; then run "python setup.py build" and 
"python setup.py install" in the Sane subdirectory to install
PIL's Sane module.
