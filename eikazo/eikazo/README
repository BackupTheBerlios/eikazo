This package provides Eikazo, a graphical frontend for Sane, which 
is intended mainly for usage with ADF scanners. It has one major 
goal: to be fast. 

Features:

- To maximize throughput for ADF scanners, a new scan is started 
  immediately after a scan has been finished. Postprocessing and
  saving of the old scan is done, while the new scan is running.

- more than one output per scan possible: You can simultaneously save 
  the scanned image into a file and send it to a printer.

- plugin mechanisms for special devices features, for post-scan image
  processing and for other "storage options".

  The device plugin mechanism allows to implement functions to support
  special device features.

  With image enhancement plugins you can automatically post-process
  the image. Currently, three plugins exist:

	o adaptive threshold
	o "dirt removal"
	o ImageMagick

  The combination of adaptive threshold and dirt removal can give better
  scan results for "problematic" originals, for example, if you want to
  extract the text from a paper with "shaded background", from an 
  stained original, or if you can't reliably predict the density of the
  ink of the text. See the sample images samples/1.tif (simple fixed 
  threshold, set in the scanner), samples/2.tif ("automatic threshold" from 
  another scanner), samples/3.tif (grayscale scan) and samples/4.tif 
  (adaptive threshold).

  The ImageMagick plugin is probably not very useful in many cases;
  some of the provided options are procesed _very_ slow -- in short: 
  it is mostly intended to show how to integrate an external image
  filter than to be directly useful. 

planned extensions and plugins:

- deskewing
- sample plugin: SQL database.
