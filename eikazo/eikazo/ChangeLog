2006-08-21	Otsu threshold added
		SaneScanToLpr: added numCopies option
		Duplex handling: class ScanJob now knows "internally",
		  if the frontside or backside of a page is scanned;

		  before a frontside scan. 
		Scan rotation added. Independent rotation options for
		  frontside and backside in duplex mode.
